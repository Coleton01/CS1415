# CS1415
A collection of work used to complete Lake Superior College Intro to programming course. 
FINAL PROJECT GUIDELINES:
This program is designed to fufill the needs of the typical biopython module user. It is a GUI.




 _________________________________________________________________________To USE_____________________________________________________________________________________
    1. the zip file will contain a "genome" folder, containing files that correspond to living creatures. These files contain sequenced DNA data and will either be in the ".fasta" , ".gbk", or ".txt." file formats.  These are the files that the program will use to perform analysis or manipulation. 
    
    2. you may choose to load a file from the genome folder, into the program. you may also click the "Find DNA" button and the program will direct you to the NCBI website where you should be able to download a .fasta or .gbk file for a chosen organism. 
    
    3. open loading a file. The program will display the contents of your file into a more user friendly format within the text area. 
    4. at this point you can choose to clear your entry with the "clear entry" button and load a different file. 
    5. when you have chossen your file, a list of statistics for your chosen dna will dispalyed near "Statistics of your genome". I have included ways to determine the GC content
    of your file and geneome length. I may add more statistical data analysis in the future.
    6. The translate and transcribe buttons will compare your genome/loaded file to a dictionary. This dictionary will coorespond to IUPAC codon tables. This will provide a conversion from linear DNA to Amino acid sequences. 
    7. The convert button will convert your file that you have loaded into a different file format.   I.E( gbk ->fasta, fasta->bgk)
